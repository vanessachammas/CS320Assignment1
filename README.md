In this assignment I have become more familiar with C++ 

My first program is a tokenizer that takes in a string and compares this string
to any words in my vector string, and also compares the string if it is a digit. 
If the string is either in the vector string or a digit it becomes a token and I 
use a function GetTokens to retrieve my tokens.

My first program also has a driver that will tokenize each line of a file and 
output errors when neccessary.

My second program is a parser that will take in a string and whether the string has
one token and is in that first vector string it will be true, and if it has two tokens 
and the first token is apart of the second vector string and the second token is a digit 
it will return true. 

My second program also has  adriver that will parse through each line of the file
and output errors when neccessary.
