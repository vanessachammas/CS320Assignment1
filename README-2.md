Vanessa Chammas Prog#4 

Prog4_1 Is implemented in python and has two functions Tokenize and Parse. 
Tokenize splits the input string by space and checks if the string is a valid word.
Parse checks through the Tokenized strings whether they are correct returning true or false

Prog4_2 Implements a StackMachine class and has the Execute function. 
This execute function accepts a list of tokens and will perform operations based on 
the tokens.

Prog4_3 Is my driver, which Tokenizes and Parse my lines in my file and then begins
executing my lines one line at a time dictaed by my StackMachine Class. Once finished
it prints the output!

Thanks for a great semester 
Have a great christmas! :-)
